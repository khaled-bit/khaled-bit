# 👋 Yo, I'm khaled.

I'm a dev who enjoys building things that actually *do stuff*.  
From security systems to 3D mockup tools, I like mixing logic with creativity.

## 💡 What I’m into

- 🔐 **Security** — OTPs, PIN flows, safe uploads, email/SMS integrations  
- ⚔️ **System Hardening** — Building secure environments and pressure-testing them  
- 🎨 **3D Design** — Building an app for mockups & interactive previews  
- ⚙️ **Clean Code** — My code is reusable, performant, and built to scale

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, PHP  
- **Frameworks:** Spring, Laravel, Blade, some custom JS  
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postman, MySQL, Figma  
- **Extras:** AJAX, API integrations, UI/UX tweaks, and a lil’ bit of 3D
